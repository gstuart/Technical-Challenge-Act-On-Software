## Background
##### Code Test Problem: _Unique permutations of a string_
In a language of your choice, write a command line utility that given a string as an input will print out all unique permutations of that string. Example inputs to consider are "aaa", "cake", and "banana".
Please include a means of building and/or packaging your utility for distribution to other systems using whatever build technologies that work for you and/or the language you've chosen.


## Install
* Install [Java JRE (Runtime Environment)](https://www.java.com/en/) _**NOTE: link to installation is for OSX**_
* Navigate to your desktop through the terminal and enter `git clone https://github.com/gstuart/Technical-Challenge-Act-On-Software.git`
* Then enter into your terminal `cd Technical-Challenge-Act-On-Software`
* In the terminal enter `javac App.java`


## Usage
* While in the project directory, enter `java App` in the terminal window.
* Enter your string and press enter.


## Approach To Challenge
1. Understand the problem.
2. Master will be my production environment.
3. Branch will be used to build and test prior to merging into Master.
4. Write solution in a language I am familiar with: Java.
